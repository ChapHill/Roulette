#Roulette

As a gaming enthusiast, I have always loved the thrill of being able to win money with the combination of chance/skill/mathematics. 
Roulette is my favorite as it requires the least understanding for one to play. 
Don't want to risk choosing just numbers? Pick a color to bet on. 
Tired of betting on a color? Switch to even/odd. 

Always gamble responsibly and set a budget for how much you would like to spend during your outing. And remember, the longer you stay at a table, house odds increase.  

This program works by creating a hastable and setting the numbers to their corresponding color. 
With roulette, you can choose to bet on the inside or outside; meaning you can choose to bet on particular numbers, or a certain color/zone of numbers.
The numbers range from 0 - 36 inclusive. 
The game creates a random number acting as the ball landing on a particular number and the player will either win or lose depending on their bet choice. 
The program will continue to play until the user quits when prompted.
